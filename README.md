- 👋 Hi, I’m @BridgetEdithNabwire
- 👀 I’m interested in music, korean cuisine, anime, computers and all things literature
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to program. The curiosity has always been there so I have finally decided to indulge.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on (for lack of better terminology) beginner projects. Particularly website development, some good conversation too and some help navigating Github is totally welcome.
- 📫 How to reach me edithnabwire35@yahoo.com
